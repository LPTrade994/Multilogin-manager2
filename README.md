# Multilogin Manager 2

This repository contains the initial scaffolding for the Amazon Multilogin Management web app. The project is split into a simple Express backend and a placeholder frontend.

## Structure

- `backend/` – Express server exposing a basic API.
- `frontend/` – Placeholder static page (to be replaced with a React app).

## Running the backend

```
npm install express
node backend/server.js
```

The server will start on port 3001 by default.
